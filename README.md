### React Task
A new hire React developer has reached out for help with a form app that they were asked to build. Upon reviewing the app you find that it is not functioning and is poorly optimized performance wise.
walk the new hire (us) through a fix for this form and some changes they could make to optimize performance. *This is very much a contrived app but act as if this is on a screen for a production app in which performance is critical for user expericence*


### TypeScript Task
The same new hire is also needing some assistance processing some data from an api that will populate some cards on our homepage. You see this as a teaching moment to help the new hire with their TypeScript skills. Help them solve the task as described in the top of the *tsSolution.ts* file. Be as explicit as possibile with your typing.
