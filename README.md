## BEFORE YOU START
- This is a live coding session be prepared to screen share and solve the tasks together.
- This prompt will have been sent ahead of the interview, but during the live session we will be using a clean verison of the ```main``` branch.
- We are looking for you to show your thought process and explain solutions. A solution that works and that you can explained in detail is better than "the optimal solution" that you can't.
- Your time is valuable! IF you have a chance to look through the tasks pre-interview spend no more than an hour working on it. 

## To Get Started
1. fork the repo to your local device
2. run ```yarn``` to install node modules
3. run ```yarn dev``` to start the app


### Your Tasks
- Finish this page as described on line 34 in App.tsx. 
- When it comes to the getTrending api response think about how to account for both a successful and unsuccessul/error/empty response.
- The form input is not updating can you explain why?
- There is a performace issue on the page as well. Using hooks built-in to React can you fix it?  Is there more than one fix? Be prepared top     explain why your fix works.
- **BONUS:** If you were to attempt to minimize rerenders as a user types in the input fields how would you go about it? NO answer is off the table, except using a third party library.
