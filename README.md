## To Get Started

1. clone the repo to your local device
2. run ```yarn``` to install node modules
3. run ```yarn dev``` to start the app

### Your Task
A new hire developer has reached out for help with a form app that they were asked to build in a ticket. Upon reviewing the app you find that it is not functioning and is poorly optimized for performance and error handling.  *This is very much a contrived app but act as if this is on a screen for a production app in which performance is critical for user expericence*

- Walk the new hire (us) through a fix for the form input not updating and then a fix for the laggy input response.
- This component also fetches data from an api. Do we need to worry about error handling? If so how do we implement?
- You also see that the ticket is unfinished (line 34 in App.tsx). This would be a great teaching opportunity for the new hire to learn some TypeScript.
